# Dark Mode Wallpaper Switcher

This is a simple app that switches your wallpaper depending on if you're in light or dark mode.

The latest release hosted here is old. Version 1.1 will be available on the Mac App Store soon. The source code hosted here is for the new version.

For App Store reasons, you can view the privacy policy [here](placeholder://).

A few caveats:

* Due to macOS limitations, I can't change every space's wallpaper at once. Therefore, when you switch spaces, it updates the wallpaper on that space.
* It's a known bug that when updating the wallpaper using the same file URL that points to a different image, it doesn't use the updated image. I've created a workaround for this, and I wrote about it [here](https://micro.jwhamilton.co/2019/11/15/link-updating-wallpaper.html).
