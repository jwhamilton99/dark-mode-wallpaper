# Dark Mode Wallpaper Switcher

This is a simple app that switches your wallpaper depending on if you're in light or dark mode.

A few caveats:

* Due to macOS limitations, I can't change every space's wallpaper at once. Therefore, when you switch spaces, it updates the wallpaper on that space.
* It's a known bug that when updating the wallpaper using the same file URL that points to a different image, it doesn't use the updated image. I've created a workaround for this, and I wrote about it [here](https://medium.com/@jwhamilton99/updating-wallpaper-urls-in-swift-6b014792e8b).

## v1.1 CHANGELOG

New:

* I rewrote the process of setting the wallpaper images. Now, you can pick images right from the app!
* The app now supports any image format. It's no longer locked to .jpg files.

Changed:

* Removed the "How To Use" menu item, as the process is so much more simple.
