# Dark Mode Wallpaper Switcher

This is a simple app that switches your wallpaper depending on if you're in light or dark mode.

How to use:

* Download the app [here](https://github.com/jwhamilton99/dark-mode-wallpaper/releases)
* Put 2 images (must be JPEGs, sorry) in the app's folder, "light.jpg" and "dark.jpg"
* Switch your appearance

A few caveats:

* Due to macOS limitations, I can't change every space's wallpaper at once. Therefore, when you switch spaces, it updates the wallpaper on that space.
* It's a known bug that when updating the wallpaper using the same file URL that points to a different image, it doesn't use the updated image. I've created a workaround for this, and I wrote about it [here](https://micro.jwhamilton.co/2019/11/15/link-updating-wallpaper.html).
