# Dark Mode Wallpaper Switcher Privacy Policy

DMWS doesn't collect any data. There's no way for it to even talk to the internet.

You can look at the source code [here](https://github.com/jwhamilton99/dark-mode-wallpaper), and confirm for yourself that this app barely does anything other than switch your wallpaper.
